With the www profiler you can:
==============================

- see which updates for your dats are available in the www
- see newly available datfiles as well
- hide/show old,new,local and updated dats
- add as many www-sites (which support clrmamepro's www profiler) as you want
- etc etc...



I - What the common datfile user should know:
=============================================



How to access the www profiler?
===============================

In the profiler window you'll find a new button called 'WWW Mode'. You can
also use the popupmenu which got that option as well. You can go back to
standard profiler mode by selecting the button / menu item again.



How to use it?
==============

First of all you need a WWW site which supports clrmamepro's www profiler
feature. "Support" is nothing but providing a XML file with datfile
information. You as a user don't have to care about that, you only need to
know the URL of such a file.

Click on "Add Site" and enter the URL of such a XML file and give an alias
name for it in the next appearing window. Clicking on OK will try to connect
to the given address, it will download the xml file, validates it and you'll
see the just added site in the profiler tree window (left) and the provided
datfiles in the profiler list (right).

The list shows the datfile description, the version and a status.

Status can be:
new - you don't have the datfile yet.
old - you got a newer version on your harddisk already.
update - you got an older version of the datfile on your harddisk.
local -  you got exactly the same datfile already on your harddisk

The popup menu holds options to show/hide dats with a status new/old/update
or local similar to the normal profiler mode hide green/red etc...

The icon of the www site treeicon and the dats themselves can have 2 states.
The normal look and the same icons but with a little red *. That red * means,
the dat/www site was updated (or new) since the last refresh.

Talking of refreshs:
Hitting the refresh sites button will look if your listed www sites updated
their xml files. and will automatically download a newer version.

Doubleclicking or selecting datfiles and clicking on download will download
the dats to your clrmamepro datfile folder. After downloading you can return
to the profiler and you'll find the just downloaded datfiles in either the
"new/not used datfiles" profiler folder or it <datfiles>. This depends on the
status of the datfiles.

If you don't want to see the "return to profiler" prompt after a download, you
disable it in the profiler options window.


That's basically it for the common user.

1) Add a site or more (you have to find out the URLs of the xml files
though, but I guess datfile providers will add xmls in the near future)
2) select the files you want to download and click on download
3) go back to the profiler to access it



Security issues?
================

clrmamepro uses standard http connects on port 80. There is no data transfered
from your PC to somewhere in the internet.

Trust your datfile profider. Be sure you get valid datfiles from that site.



Something fails
===============

Well...if you got a firewall, you have to allow clrmamepro to access the
internet (http connects on port 80). If downloads fail, the datfile profider
may have changed his xmlfile location or datfile location. Ask the providers
for further support then. Another possible error is an error in the xml file.
Again, contact the dat provider.



Known issues:
=============

WWW caching can be evil. The datfile provider may updated his datfiles and the
xml but internet caches prevents it from being detected as new. Usually after
some time it'll be detected. Caching can also affect downloading of zips. The
xml was updated with new datfilelocations, but caching reports a 'file not
found' at the location. You simply have to wait a while before it's accessable.


Datfile status doesn't have to be 100% correct. Although the detector is
rather clever, it may fail on weird datheader information. If datfile authors
use a common version numbering everything's fine.

Some datfile authors use the same datfile header name tag in multiple
datfiles. This results in wrong or multiple equal status values.









II - What a datfile provider has to know
=========================================


You have to provide a XML file containing datfile information about
datfiles you want to provide.


The XML File
============

The syntax of the xml file is as follows:

<clrmamepro>
   <datfile>
      <name></name>
      <description></description>
      <version></version>
      <author></author>
      <comment></comment>
      <url></url>
      <file></file>
   </datfile>

   <datfile>.....</datfile>
   <datfile>.....</datfile>
   <datfile>.....</datfile>
</clrmamepro>


Example:
========

<clrmamepro>
   <datfile>
      <name>MAME Artwork</name>
      <description>MAME Artwork 20050808</description>
      <version>20050808</version>
      <author>R.Scherzer www.clrmame.com</author>
      <comment>&lt;insert comment&gt;</comment>
      <url>www.clrmame.com/datfiles/MAME/MAME Artwork 20050808 (cm).zip</url>
      <file>MAME Artwork 20050808 (cm).dat</file>
   </datfile>
   <datfile>
      <name>MAME Flyers</name>
      <description>MAME Flyers 20050711</description>
      <version>20050711</version>
      <author>Gerard Maathuis</author>
      <comment>The Xray1 Farewell pack</comment>
      <url>www.clrmame.com/datfiles/MAME/MAME Flyers 20050711 (cm).zip</url>
      <file>MAME Flyers 20050711 (cm).dat</file>
   </datfile>
</clrmamepro>


- clrmamepro tags mark the start and end of the file
- datfile tags mark the start and end of one datfile definition
- name is the datfile name (as you know it already from a datfile)
- description is the datfile description (as you know it already from a
  datfile)
- version, author and comment like in your dats
- url points to the datfile on your page (www.bla.com/test.dat) or to
  a zipfile containing the datfile (www.bla.com/zippeddats/test1.zip)
- file can be empty if url points to a datfile. It has been filled if url
  points to a zipfile. file is the name of the datfile inside the zipfile,
  WITH a possible zipsubfoldername. ("test\test.dat")

name, description, version and url are mandatory entries. file is mandatory
if url points to zipfile

Your page can provide more than one xml file of course. Useful if you want
to separate datfiles by some characteristic.



How to generate such a XML file?
================================


clrmamepro got a xml creator included. You can access it either in the
popupmenu of the www profile mode or by using the clrmamepro binary from the
commmandline with some parameters:

The GUI creator:

You have to select

- an URL prestring
- a folder with datfiles or a listfile (see further down below)
- a destination filename for the xml

The destination filename for the XML is the name of the file which gets
created.

The URL prestring is used to create the XML url tag. It's a prestring to
the datfile filename.

The folder is a folder which gets scanned for dats recursively. The given
foldername is used as a rootfolder and won't be added to the url tag. Found
Subfolder will be added.


Instead of a folder with datfiles you can use a filename which points to a
plain text file which includes a list of folders and files.

For example:

d:\temp\dats\
d:\temp2\other\mame.dat


there is another option which allows you to keep some parts of the listed
folder/files in the url xml tag.

d:\temp\dats\; dats
d:\temp2\other\mame.dat

See that ";" and the "dats" behind it? Normally d:\temp\dats would be used
as the datfiles root for xml url tag creation. So if you got a file named
"d:\temp\dats\test.dat" you'll end with a
<url><your_www_prestring>/test.dat<url>. Specifying "; dats" will keep the
"dats" part of the folderstatement. It will result in:
<url><your_www_prestring>/dats/test.dat<url>.


You can also use cmpro.exe to create xmls.

cmpro.exe /xml <www_prestring> <folder or listfile> <destination file> /pack /r

/pack packs the created xml to a zipfile
/r also scans subfolders

For example:

cmpro.exe /xml www.clrmame.com d:\temp\dats c:\mydats.xml
cmpro.exe /xml www.clrmame.com d:\temp\datlist.txt c:\mydats.xml

with datlist.txt:

d:\temp\dats\; dats
d:\temp2\other\mame.dat



What's the bandwidth usage?
===========================

clrmamepro checks if the date/timestamp of the xml file has changed on your
www site when the user hits the "refresh sites" button. If not, it won't
download it.

You can keep the xml file zipped, too, so this will minimize bandwidth usage
as well.

If a user selects more than one datfile from the same zipfile, the zip is
only downloaded once (until clrmamepro is closed or the zipfile gets changed
on the server).

You still watch your bandwidth since it's not known how many people will use
this feature and will download and download and download and .....

To prevent caching issues you should update the dats first, wait a while and
then update the xml. Otherwise you may run into trouble that the xml is
available while the dats aren't yet accessible for the users.
